# Custom DirectX11 Physics Simulation

A custom-built physics and rendering engine developed in C++ using DirectX 11. I designed this in a few weeks for my university assignment. I should note that I have'nt touched this since submitting it, therefore it could do with a rework.

## ✨ Features

### ⚙️ Physics Features
- **Rigidbody system**
- **Velocity, acceleration, and gravity**
- **Drag, thurst and friction**
- **Object collision detection and response**
- **Custom update loop and physics integration**
- **Buoyancy**

### 🖼 Rendering Features
- **2D and 3D shape rendering**
- **Simple camera system**
- **DirectX 11 powered rendering pipeline**
- **Real-time visual feedback**

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Language: C++**
- **Graphics API: DirectX 11**
- **Tools: Visual Studio, HLSL**

## 🧠 What I Learned

Building this from scratch taught me a lot about low-level graphics programming, physics integration, and engine architecture.

## 📈 Future Plans
- Add better collision resolution with edge cases
- Implement advanced physics materials
- Extend the rendering system with lighting and post-processing
